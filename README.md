##Predict correct sinewave output using the input sine wave with noise.
### It takes a sine wave + noise and produces output sine wave which is smooth and free from noise.
Check for output jpeg/png for machine learning output.
### The model currently uses Decision trees to build a predictive model.Libraries used are scipy, numpy, matplotlib and pandas
